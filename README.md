# InforMED
Text summarizing Google Chrome extension for nwHacks 2022.

## Problem Statement
Navigating the internet is not always easy. Many webpages have lengthy paragraphs and use complex jargon in their writing forcing readers to spend precious hours decoding the information. This can especially be a struggle for non-native speakers, having to adapt to new sentence structures while also translating complicated words.

## Solution
Using DeepAI's summarization API endpoint, we reduced down long input text into easy to read, bit-sized sentences. Users who no longer want to read chunky articles or papers can simply open up InforMED, copy and paste, and get back their summarized information.
